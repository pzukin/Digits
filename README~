This repository contains multiple python programs that use different machine learning algorithms on the kaggle Digit Recognizer competition.

The training and test data sets are also in the repository in case you wanted to try out the code.

digitSVM.py utilizes support vector machine

digitRot.py experiments with how good of a distinguisher the eigenvalues of a digits moment of inertia tensor can be. The motivation is that the eigenvalues are independent of orientation of the digit.

utils.py contains functions that are used in the above programs
