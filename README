This repository contains multiple python programs that use different machine learning algorithms on the kaggle Digit Recognizer competition.

The training and test data sets are also in the repository in case you wanted to try out the code.

digitSVM.py utilizes support vector machine

digitRot.py experiments with using calculated features that are independent of the digit's primary axis relative to the axes of the image. This naturally takes into account the issue with some people writing digits that are slanted. Then uses SVM on this new feature set.

utils.py contains functions that are used in the above programs
